# Employee Polls Project (React + Redux)

This project was completed as a part of the React Nanodegree Program (Udacity) in October 2022 by JosÃ© Imedio.

It consists on a web app to be used internally at a simulated company. This app allows employees to create polls to be answered by their colleagues and themselves. 

The app consists of 4 pages:
- Log In: the user simply chooses their name from a list. 
- Home: contains all polls available, divided into answered and unanswered. The user can complete the ones they didn't complete before. And also see the results of the ones they already completed. 
- Leaderboard: classification table showing how many polls each user created and how many they answered. 
- New: create a new poll.

## Possible improvements
Include a proper login system, instead of simply choosing a name from a list.
Improve the web app design, which is currently extremely basic.
